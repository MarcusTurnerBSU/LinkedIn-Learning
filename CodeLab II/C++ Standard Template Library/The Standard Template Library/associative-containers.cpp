/*
Below will show the logical operation rather than the implementation of these containers.
A set is a model of mathematical set which is a collection of unique elements that serve us keys. This means
you can't insert some element twice as the set will not change the second time because it already has an element.

There are four variants of sets which come from two aspects, ordered and unordered 

mathematical set 
• implementation
	•  ordered sets as binary tress
	•  unordered sets as hash tables

• does not accept duplicates
• for duplicates, use multisets

There are four types of set implementations in C++ STL - regular set, regular multiset, unordered set and unordered multiset

A Map is a set of pairs - pairs are special struct templates that implement the storage of two different class objects
also known an a tuple(couple but with a t instead). The two elements of a pair are called first and second.

Map 
•  pairs are two tuples
•  map implementation is similar to sets
•  for duplicates, use multimaps
