/*
STL consists of four components - containers, iterators, algorithms, functors

containers - array-like data structurs that store collections of objects

iterators - pointer-like objects that allow traversal of containers

algorithms - collection of algorithm implementations for operations, such as search and sort

functors - function objects that can be parametrised in their constructors
